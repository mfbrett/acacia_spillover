# Scripts

All the R scripts for data analysis and figures are located in the `scripts/` folder of this repository.

## a) Data analysis

*Acacia flower counts*: to reproduce the regression lines used to predict acacia flower densities at sites, use `acaciaregression_.r`

*For analyses regarding the visitation to and seed set of 3 focal plant species*: use `focals_analysis_.R`

*For all other analyses*: including visitation networks, use `main_analysis_.r`

## b) Main text Figures

*Figure 3: Visitation network analyses*: The code to produce the panels in Figure 2 can be found in `main_analysis_.r`
*Figure 4: Focal species analyses*: The code to produce the panels in Figure 3 can be found in `focals_.r`

## c) Supplimentary material figures

*Figure S1: Site Map*: The script concerning map plotting is `sitemap_.r`
*Figure S3: Visitation networks*: Plant-insect visitation networks: `webillustration_.r`
