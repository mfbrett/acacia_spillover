# Scripts

All the R scripts for data analysis and figures are located in the `scripts/` folder of this repository.

## a) Data analysis

*Acacia flower counts*: to reproduce the regression lines used to predict acacia flower densities at sites, use 'acaciaregression_.r'
*For analyses regarding the visitation to and seed set of 3 focal plant species*: use 'focals_analysis_.r'
*For all other analyses*: including visitation networks, use 'main_analysis_.r'

## b) Main text Figures

*Figures 2 & 3*: The code to produce Figures 2 & 3 can be found in 'main_analysis_.r'

## c) Supplimentary material figures

*Visitation networks*: Plant-insect visitation networks: 'X.r'
*Site Map*: The script concerning map plotting is `sitemap_.r'
